## Authors:
Simran Bhatia, Radhika Jayachandran

## Problem Setting:
Research and implement data mining models to predict the course of a season given the inherent unpredictability of the sport. Through the project, considerations and processes used to implement models to predict the course of the 2021 Formula 1 season were explored.

## Problem Definition:
The intention of this analysis is to identify factors that successfully determine race outcomes and to apply data mining techniques to design a model which predicts race statistics for upcoming championships.
